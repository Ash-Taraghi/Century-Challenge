# Century Challenge App

## Introduction
Every year, my friends and I take on a challenge where we perform a specific task once every minute until we reach 100 rounds. For example, this year's challenge is to do 10 pushups every minute until we complete 100 rounds, totaling 1000 pushups (not something I'm particularly looking forward to!).

## Motivation
Surprisingly, there doesn't seem to be an existing app tailored specifically for this type of challenge. So, I decided to create one myself!

## About the App
The Century Challenge App is designed to help you track and manage your progress during the Century Challenge. Whether you're doing pushups, situps, squats, or any other activity, this app will keep you on track and motivated until you reach your goal of completing 100 rounds.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Timer functionality to track each round
- Option to set the number of repetitions per round
- Visual feedback to indicate when each round begins and ends
- Progress tracking to monitor how many rounds you've completed
- Motivational messages to keep you going throughout the challenge

## How to Use
1. Set the number of repetitions you want to perform per round.
2. Go to the website and the timer will start automatically.
3. Perform the specified activity once every minute until you complete 100 rounds.
4. Celebrate your accomplishment when you reach the finish line!
